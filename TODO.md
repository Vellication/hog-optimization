This project is still very early in its development, and there's a lot to do! This is not exactly a roadmap, but moreso a list of things I need to get done before the scope/goals are properly defined:
* Create example 1D strategy space (always_roll(0-10))
* Show what I have done up to this point in terms of simulation/experiemntation
* Explain what I don't know/need help on (especially in terms of simulation/experiment methodology, how do I know my results are valid, etc.)
* Create a better definition of strategy space. I'm currently only using the parameters that can be tweaked within a given strategic flowchart, but the flowchart itself also defines the space.
  * Probably something along the lines of genetic algorithms - a strategy could have some set of parameter (space-widening), parameter constraints(space-narrowing), and logical genes(space-narrowing, I think, but could do both).
